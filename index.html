                    <span>Crescent Childcare is a home daycare center, licensed by the State of Illinois, dedicated to providing a high quality, nurturting, and safe learning
                        environment for your child that will help him/her grow into a wonderful, curious, and happy person.

                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>We provide a secure and safe learning environment for all children that encourages self-expression (care for self) and
                    group responsibility (care for others); offers an area through which your children may discover and express their
                    personal potential through exploration and experimentation. It is important for parents to feel good about bringing
                    their children to a safe and nourishing environment. It is our privilege to assure that every child experiences these
                    basic rights.</p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Program</h3>
                <p>Our program varies to fit the needs of you and your child. We provide high-quality full-time childcare for children and
                infants, newborn through 12 years. Breakfast, lunch, and snacks are prepared in accordance with federal food guidelines
                and are served to the children “family style”. Activities are scheduled but we often follow child-initiated activities
                to encourage curiosity and wonderment of life.</p>
                <h3>Cirriculum</h3>
                <p>Our weekly activities are well balanced for group and free play, and consist of learning activities that will help your
                child develop his/her emotional, physical, intellectual, and social skills. In the morning we allow about an hour of
                free play before going into circle time. Circle time consists of music and movement followed by a story. Next, we move
                into the kitchen for our preschool lessons, which include science, Spanish, math, writing, and art activities before we
                transition them back into free play.
                
                In the summer our program is geared towards being outside and enjoying the sun. We go for walks, use water tables, have
                bubbles, ride bikes, and have picnic lunches in the backyard on child-sized picnic tables.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>My goal is to provide a high quality, nurturing, and safe learning environment for your child that will help him/her
                grow into a wonderful, curious, and happy person. I maintain a structured daily program with regards to scheduled meals,
                rest periods, and activities because I believe children thrive best when their lives are organized.</p>
                <h3>Asima Baig - Director</h3>
                <p>I hold a Master’s degree in social science and a Bachelor’s degree in education. I also possess an associate’s degree
                in Early Childhood Education from Oakton Community College. I was also recognized as a President’s Scholar each
                semester. In addition, I have a Preschool Certificate for children 3-5 years of age and received my state credentials
                for Early Childhood Education through Gateways Professional Development Program. Beyond my education, I have worked with
                children in the early childhood setting for more than 10 years. In addition to my daycare experience, I am the mother of
                three children—all of whom have succeeded outstandingly in their educational pursuits. My daughter graduated college
                from Yale University and graduated from medical school at Harvard University. My oldest son is a CPA, and my youngest son is a software engineer.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Testimonials</h3>
                <p>Asima, the owner of Crescent, is absolutely wonderful. When I suddenly needed a caregiver for my toddler because my
                    mother-in-law had to
                    travel overseas, I contacted Asima to see if she could temporarily take care of my child. She was quick to respond
                    and exceptionally warm
                    in her welcome. I got to visit her home the next day and was impressed by the sheer quantity of learning materials
                    and toys.
                    My daughter didn't want to leave! We decided to keep our child under Asima's care and are so glad for this decision.
                    My daughter loved her
                    experience there and we are definitely coming back when we need more childcare!
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: -15px; margin-left: 20px;">- Lola</p>
                <p>Asima, the owner and care giver, is very respectful of our wishes as parents. She also very clearly loves the children she watches.
                I appreciate the cirriculum, while also maintaining a "learn from doing" mentalility (allowing kids to learn from activities outdoors, etc).
                Asima is flexible to our needs and circumstances, making her very easy to work with.
