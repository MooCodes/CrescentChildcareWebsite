                <hr>
                <h4>Asima Baig - Director</h4>
                <p>I hold a Master’s degree in social science and a Bachelor’s degree in education. I also possess an associate’s degree
                in Early Childhood Education from Oakton Community College. I was also recognized as a President’s Scholar each
                semester. In addition, I have a Preschool Certificate for children 3-5 years of age and received my state credentials
                for Early Childhood Education through Gateways Professional Development Program. Beyond my education, I have worked with
                children in the early childhood setting for more than 10 years. In addition to my daycare experience, I am the mother of
                three children—all of whom have succeeded outstandingly in their educational pursuits. My daughter graduated college
                from Yale University and graduated from medical school at Harvard University. My oldest son is a CPA, and my youngest son is a software engineer.</p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Testimonials</h4>
                <p>Asima, the owner of Crescent, is absolutely wonderful. When I suddenly needed a caregiver for my toddler because my
                    mother-in-law had to
                    travel overseas, I contacted Asima to see if she could temporarily take care of my child. She was quick to respond
                    and exceptionally warm
                    in her welcome. I got to visit her home the next day and was impressed by the sheer quantity of learning materials
                    and toys.
                    My daughter didn't want to leave! We decided to keep our child under Asima's care and are so glad for this decision.
                    My daughter loved her
                    experience there and we are definitely coming back when we need more childcare!
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: -15px; margin-left: 20px;">- Lola</p>
                <p>Asima, the owner and care giver, is very respectful of our wishes as parents. She also very clearly loves the children she watches.
                I appreciate the cirriculum, while also maintaining a "learn from doing" mentalility (allowing kids to learn from activities outdoors, etc).
                Asima is flexible to our needs and circumstances, making her very easy to work with.
